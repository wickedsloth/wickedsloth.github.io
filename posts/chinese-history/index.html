      <h1>Modern Era: Late Qing Dynasty and birth of the Republic of China.</h1>
<h3>First Opium War (1841)</h3>
<p>After its military victories, the British Empire forced China to concede treaty ports like Shanghai and Guangzhou. </p>
<h3>Taiping Rebellion (1850-1864)</h3>
<p>Hong Xiuquan, a Chinese student born third and youngest son of a poor Hakka family, met with Edwin Stevens, a foreign missionary in Guangzhou. Failing the imperial examination for three times led to a nervous breakdown. During his convalescence, Hong dreamt of visiting the heaven and viewed himself as the literal son of God and younger brother of Jesus Christ. </p>
<p>Hong started as a teacher in a small village. Consequently, he started to preach his visions and divine mission to his community and destroyed Confucian and Buddhist statues. The prophet Isaiah was of particular influence on Hong.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your country is desolate, your cities burned with fire; your fields are being stripped by foreigners right before you, laid waste as when overthrown by strangers.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Isaiah 1:7</p>
<p>The mountains of Guanxi were fertile ground for rebellion. By 1850, Hong had between 10,000 to 30,000 followers. Revolutionary cells were created in hundreds of villages. </p>
<p>In spring 1850, the revolution began. Soon Hong gathered a 100,000 men army and defeater the Qing forces in the South. Nanjing falls in 1853 where the God' Heavenly Kingdom was established. The new regime banned opium tobacco, alcohol, foot binding, prostitution, gambling, separated the sexes, private property, representations or human forms. </p>
<p>Foreign forces saw the Taiping rebellion as a threat and lent advisors and weaponry to crush the rebels. The Qing massed a one million men army and the Taiping were forced back behind the walls of Nanjing. Eventually, Hong fell ill and died. The remaining Taiping leaders massacred. Twenty million people died during the rebellion, worst war in the 19th century.</p>
<h3>Taiping Rebellion (1899-1901)</h3>
<p>In 1895, China was humiliated in a disastrous war against Japan. Russia, Japan, Germany Britain and France imposed their rules on the weakened country. The boxers swept on Beijin in 1899 with a mix of mysticism and martial art, calling for wiping out of foreign influence. The foreign powers were trapped during 55 days. A 20,000 relief army from the 8 foreign powers marched from the coast and took revenge. The boxers were crushed and reparations were imposed on China. In central Beijin, the foreign powers demanded that the Legation Quarted was asked to be established and administered by them.</p>
<h3>End of the Qing Dynasty</h3>
<p>The Qing Dynasty, exhausted after years of foreign invasion, the Taiping and Boxer Rebellions, collapsed with the death of Emperor Guangxu, likely poisoned, and the Empress Dowager Cixi in 1908. The succession goes to the two year old nephew to the deceased Emperor with Zaifeng as regent. However, the created cabinet, known as the "Royal Cabinet" was viewed negatively.</p>
<p>On October 10, 1911, the Wuchang Uprizing, coalition of the army, bankers and the urban bourgeoisie led to the creation of the Republic of China in Nanjing with Sun Yat-sen as its provisional head. In 1912, the boy emperor was forced to abdicate.</p>
<h3>Republic of China</h3>
<p>During the first World War, China provided nearly 150,000 to the allied forces on the Western front.</p>
